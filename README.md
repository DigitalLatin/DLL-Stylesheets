# DLL Stylesheets

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/TEIC/Stylesheets.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.com/TEIC/Stylesheets)

This repository contains a customization of the [TEI XSL Stylesheets](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets) for the purposes of transforming critical editions encoded according to the [Digital Latin Library's encoding guidelines](https://github.com/DigitalLatin/guidelines).

Although this repository includes XSLT stylesheets for transforming TEI XML documents to various formats, the customization efforts to date have focused on transforming edition data to LaTeX for the creation of print-ready PDFs.

For more information on the TEI XSL Stylesheets and their use, see the documentation at [https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets).
